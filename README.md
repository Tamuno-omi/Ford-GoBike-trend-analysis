# (FordGo bike trip data Investigation)
## by (Tamuno-omi Jaja)


## Dataset

The Ford GoBike System data includes information about individual rides covering the greater San Francisco Bay area, The dataset contains 183,412 individual rides and 16 features that outline customer information, the ride duration and start-end destination. In this notebook, I will be looking at the relationship Ride duration has with other variables, in other to accomplish this I will perform the various steps below.


## Summary of Findings

There are two Client groups using the Ford GoBike service, namely Customers and Subscribers. Here are some of the key insights I ganered:

1. As envisaged Ride Duration is related to Ride distance, but another features which determines the duration of a trip is the previous usage of the bike, It was observed that bikes with less that 25 previous rides were able to accomplish ride duration of above 50 minutes, as a result were the only category of bikes to cover above 3km distance for trips.

2. Both member groups see peak ride duration on Wednesday and Thursday for trips that started between 2 to 4 am.

3. FordGo members take more trips on weekdays which peak on thursdays and falls on weekends, in addition they cover a higher distances on weekdays for trips that started between 5 to 9 am.


## Key Insights for Presentation

In the Bay Area, July which is in Summer in the Northen Hemispher is the most popular time to use the Ford Go Bike sharing system. March is also the second most popular time to use the Ford Go Bike sharing system in the Bay Area.
While December which is Winter time in the Northern Hemisphere, is the least popular time to use the Ford Go Bike Sharing System. Therefore, there will be more bikes available due to the usuage of bikes not been used around the Christmas Holidays.
